This document is the first of my `R`{.bash}-markdown files. This document contains code
and $\LaTeX$. To use the $\LaTeX$ syntax, use the following in `R`{.bash}-markdown.
```r
output:

```
## Arithmetic in R
Arithmetic in `R`{.bash} is quite simple. You can run it in the Console or run it line by line in the source file.
R supports $+,-,/,\cdot,$ and even modular arithmetic. Below are some examples.
```r
1+2 #Addition.
5-2 #Subtraction.
5*2 #Multiplication.
5/2 #Division.
5 %% 2 #Modular Arthimetic.
(5*2) + (5-3) #Order of operations.
```
## Variables
When it comes to variables in R there is a different assignment operator. This is the arrow operator `<-`{.r}
Below is how to use this operator on assigning `var`{.bash} the value `5`{.bash}.
```r
var <- 5 #5 is now stored as the variable "var."
```
The naming convention in R is variables are either camel case, or the space between words is represented as a `.`{.bash}
```r
bank.account <- 20 #"period" notation.
bankAccount <-872 #camel case.
```
## Basic Data Types
In R we have a variety of data types like `numberic, logical, character`{.bash}, etc. We can find out what variables data type is by calling a function called `class()`{.r}
```r
var <- 100
trueVar <- TRUE
falseVar <- FALSE
myName <- "Michael Dick"
class(var) #outputs: numeric
class(trueVar) #outputs: logical
class(falseVar) #outputs: logical
class(myName) #outputs: character
```
## Vector Basics
Vectors in R are 1-D arrays. The unique thing about these vectors is that they can act as a dictionary in Python. To initialize a vector in R we use the syntax: `vec <- c(10, 20 ,30)`{.r} where `c`{.bash} is a a function that combines all of these variables to be a part of this array. Now we can associate meaning to certain variable types. Look at the following:
```r
days <- c("Mon", "Tues", "Weds", "Thurs", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun") #Array of characters.
temps <- c(72, 55, 79, 60, 80, 70, 69) #Array of numerics.
names(temps) <- days #names assigns each item in temps a name from days
temps
```
`temps`{.bash} will display the following:
```r
 Mon  Tues  Weds Thurs   Fri   Sat   Sun 
   72    55    79    60    80    70    69 
```

## Vector Indexing and Slicing
With R it is VERY IMPORTANT to remember that indexing in R starts at `1`{.bash} rather than `0`{.bash}. There is a few unique things we can perform on vectors. Let's look at sample code:
```r
v1 <- c(100,200,300)
v2 <- c(a,b,c) 
v1[1] #Returns 100
temps[5] #Returns  Fri 
#                   80 
temps[2:4] #Splicing
#Returns: Tues  Weds Thurs 
#           55    79    60 
temps[c(1,7)] #Grab index 1 and index 7
temps["Mon"] #Returns the number assoicated with "Mon"
temps[c("Tues", "Fri")]
#Filter out values less than 2
vnum <- c(1,2,3,4)
vchar <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
names(vnum) <- vchar
vnum[vnum > 2] #Returns 3 and 4
vnum > 2
###################################
myFilter <- vnum > 2
vnum[myFilter]
###################################
```
For the `#`{.R} section of this code block you see we assign an array of logical operations. We can call this `myFiler`{.bash}. `myFilter`{.bash} will contain `{FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE}`{.R} and when we run `vnum[myFiler]`{.R} and this will return all the numbers that are greater than 2. It produces the result: 
```.code
c d 
3 4 
```
## Getting Help in R
To get help in R with variable names, functions, etc, you can easily do this in two ways.
<br>
<br>
1. Using `help()`{.R}, in the parthensis you would add what you need help one. For example, if you wanted help with vectors you would type `help("vector")`{.R} in the Console tab in RStudio.
<br>
<br>
2. Getting help by typing `?`{.bash} in front of what you want help with. Like in the last example, this is what you would use if you want to find more information on vectors `?.vectors`{.bash}









```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
