This document is the first of my `R`{.bash}-markdown files. This document contains code
and $\LaTeX$. To use the $\LaTeX$ syntax, use the following in `R`{.bash}-markdown.
```r

Arithmetic in `R`{.bash} is quite simple. You can run it in the Console or run it line by line in the source file.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
